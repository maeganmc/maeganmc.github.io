In high school, I completed a research paper using computational biology methods to compare the two known types of clonally transmissible cancer, Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) and canine transmissible veneral tumor (CTVT). To do this, I identified the specific protiens or genes that are considered to be markers for the different types of cancers and then employed several different biology databases such as Ensembl and UniProt to create computational profiles for the genes that represented both diseases. It was concluded that CTVT's marker genes tend to be expressed in much more localized locations than DFTD's, which is why DFTD is much harder to treat than CTVT.
