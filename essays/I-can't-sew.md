## I'm a Computer Science student, not a . . .

I have only known what design patterns are in a computer science context for approximately 24 hours. Before then, I never would have even thought that the phrase had a computer science context at all – it sounds more like something that would be of interest to a fashion designer, not a burgeoning software developer. Since then, I have taken a deep dive to discover the true depth of the error in my thinking. A design pattern, I have learned, is something designed to make my life easier. It is a solution that I can duplicate to address common problems in my coding. Of course, as soon as I heard this, my interest was piqued; I am still new to software development, so errors abound in my code. Was this a way to help mitigate the problems in my code? Maybe even a panacea for all coding difficulties? Sign me up!


## It’s Not That Easy

But what's that easy? Not design patterns! To my consternation, I discovered design patterns were certainly not an immediate solution to all of my coding woes. Although understanding the various design patterns will unquestionably help me become a more competent software developer, it is certainly no quick fix. As I perused more materials on design patterns, I even realized something else. Far from being a magical new cure-all, design patterns were already in my software developer kit of tricks. It was only the name I was truly coming across for the first time, because the concepts themselves I have used multiple times unknowingly.
